    "chunk": "In a week in which former allies in a redividing globe separately commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, the sense of a runaway descent towards a third world war draws ever closer. The implosion of Pax Americana, the interconnectedness of conflicts, the new willingness to resort to unbridled state-sponsored violence and the irrelevance of the institutions of the rules-based order have all been on brutal display this week. From Kashmir to Khan Younis, Hodeidah, Port Sudan and Kursk, the only sound is of explosions, and the only lesson is that the old rules no longer apply. Indeed Fiona Hill, the policy analyst and adviser to the UK government on its imminent strategic defence review, argues the third world war has already started, if only we would recognise it. The fear of a world in which no one, due to science or globalisation, is any longer in control is hardly new: the concept was the title of two Reith lectures, one in 1967 by the social anthropologist Edmund Leach and another in 1999 by the political philosopher Anthony Giddens. But rarely has been it so clear that the rules-based world order created in 1945 is in headlong retreat. The former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband put it well this week at Chatham House, saying: \u201cI know that people always say the world is changing, but this feels like a moment of genuine geopolitical flux, at least as significant as 1989-90 when the world transitioned from the cold war to a unipolar moment, and for me the Trump administration is both symptom and cause of the changes under way. \u201cThe problem is that it\u2019s much more clear what we are inflecting from \u2013 a world in which the US was the anchor of the global system"

I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about the idea of a multipolar world reflecting a redistribution of the balance of power, but I find that concept conveying too much stability, too much security.\u201d His one-time mentor Tony Blair, in a talk in California, argued: \u201cEveryone has been shaken out of their comfort zone. The noise you are hearing from the political undergrowth is the frantic foraging for options. People are rethinking their position in the world and their relationships. There is no doubt at all this is a major shock. This is the most significant geostrategic event I can remember in terms of America and the world.\u201d For the former US secretary of state Antony Blinken, Donald Trump\u2019s indifference to alienating allies is an act of vandalism. He said diplomats around the world were asking: \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Blinken said America had spent 80 years building up trust, strong economic partnerships and military and political alliances, and if that was then taken down in a matter of 100 days it would be incredibly hard to rebuild. \u201cIt means countries look for ways to work around us, to work together but without the US,\u201d he said. \u201cThe possibility that what will be said today will be reversed tomorrow, and will be reversed again, means they simply cannot count on us.

It may or may not be a world war but it is a world at war. In Gaza the world has watched as a blockade on food, aid and medical supplies, in defiance of binding orders by the international court of justice (ICJ), has now entered into its third month. Israel, in search of security, has in the past month bombed Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. It is daily urging the US to be given permission to bomb Iran. Trump can hardly complain when Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s ultra-right finance minister, shared his vision for the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, predicting that within half a year the population of the territory would be confined to just a narrow swathe of land, with the remainder \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d. Smotrich was only repeating a version of Trump\u2019s plan to empty Gaza of Palestinians, a plan totally at odds with the ceasefire terms his envoy had negotiated. In remarks at a \u201csettlements conference\u201d, Smotrich also declared that Israel would \u201capply sovereignty\u201d in the West Bank within the lifetime of the current government, which is due to expire in October 2026 unless elections are called earlier. \u201cWithin a few months, we will be able to declare that we have won.

He denounced the blockade as \u201can absolute disgrace \u2026 It is not acceptable; deliberately cutting off all humanitarian aid, all access to food, healthcare, electricity and water, as a war strategy, is totally unacceptable.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: \u201cIf we condemn Russia for violating Ukrainian sovereignty, we cannot remain silent when it happens in Gaza. Hamas must be fought, yes, but not at the cost of trampling on all the rules.\u201d He called for a united response by Europe, yet at a foreign affairs meeting in Poland the 27 ministers could not even agree on a joint statement, let alone joint action to suspend its free trade agreement with Israel, a Dutch proposal. Meanwhile in Port Sudan, the conduit for humanitarian aid into Sudan, Rapid Support Forces drones destroyed infrastructure, just as Israeli bombs have sought to do this week in Hodeidah, the chief entry point for aid into Yemen. On Monday an effort by the Sudanese government to hold the United Arab Emirates accountable at the ICJ for directing arms to the RSF ended in failure. The UAE, like many other nations, is a signatory to the genocide convention, but it has entered a reservation insisting its compliance with the convention is not subject to ICJ proceedings.

The UAE, like many other nations, is a signatory to the genocide convention, but it has entered a reservation insisting its compliance with the convention is not subject to ICJ proceedings. The ICJ meekly concluded there was a manifest lack of jurisdiction. Only one judge, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf from Somali, objected. So the UAE gains kudos of signing the convention without needing to be judged on meeting its obligations. It has been left to the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to make a valiant effort to coax the parties to a ceasefire, but so far it has foundered. The US, by contrast, labels RSF leaders as genocidal but does nothing in practical diplomatic terms. In Kashmir, where two nuclear-armed states are firing rockets at one another\u2019s aircraft, there is a conspicuous absence of American interest. The US has no ambassador in India or Pakistan and no senior state department official appointed. The conflict is not making waves in US media, and Trump\u2019s initial response was \u201cit\u2019s a shame\u201d and that \u201cif you think about it they have been fighting for many, many decades, and centuries, actually\u201d.

A decent betrayal These conflicts may be disconnected save the common thread of absent US leadership and permanent upheaval. But in Ukraine the structural elements of the world war come together, Hill argues. The scale of the death toll may be different to the second world war, but according to the UK military this week Russia has suffered 900,000 casualties, far in excess of its losses during previous wars in Chechyna and Afghanistan. Moreover, the wars are now, in her words, \u201csystem-changing conflicts with multivector loads of countries involved\u201d. Chinese-flagged trawlers with Russians onboard rupturing undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is only one part of Vladimir Putin\u2019s global war. China, North Korea and Iran are all supporting Russia, some in more material ways such as building drone factories or supplying soldiers. A host of other countries have been happy to keep Russia economically afloat in ways that make their neutrality contestable. India, with which the UK has completed a free trade deal this week, has bought \u20ac112bn of oil from Russia since the war started, and also bought Russian arms. The conflict has been presented by Russia and its allies as a war about American hegemony.

Trump sees the world in similar terms to Putin \u2013 a handful of sovereign powers dividing up land into spheres of influence. His dream is to re-enact Yalta 1945 alongside Putin and possibly Xi Jinping, with Europe an onlooker and Ukraine dismembered. But organising a decent betrayal has proved more difficult than expected. In the White House, Trump famously told Volodymyr Zelenskyy: \u201cYou have to be thankful. You don\u2019t have the cards.\u201d But Trump overplayed the cards he had, throwing many of them away with his self-destructive tariff war. And it emerged that Zelenskyy did in fact have a few cards left, deploying them skilfully by offering a 30-day ceasefire, a minerals deal with the US, and focusing on Ukraine\u2019s military value to western security. The intimate photo of Trump and Zelenskyy in conclave at the funeral of the pope (a picture taken by Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak) reeked of reconciliation yet flattered Trump\u2019s ego. A change in mood in Washington is now discernible. Even JD Vance, the vice-president, once agitator-in-chief against Zelenskyy, this week admitted Russia was \u201casking for too much\u201d and said Europe and the US were \u201con the same team\u201d.

In a speech marking VE Day, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, explained the double necessity for Europe to be prepared for war. Russia\u2019s war of aggression had shattered the European security order, with the imperial delusion that the war in Ukraine could be conflated with the great patriotic war. Then he added: \u201cThe fact that now even the United States, who did so much to create and shape this order, is turning its back on it is a shock on an entirely new scale. That is why I speak of a double epochal shift \u2013 Russia\u2019s war of aggression and the US break with its values \u2013 that is what marks the end of this long 20th century.\u201d Europe, he insisted, must decide what comes next."

    "chunk": "Simon Mann, an Eton and Sandhurst-educated ex-SAS officer, who led a botched coup involving Margaret Thatcher\u2019s son to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea, has died aged 72. Mann led a group of 70 fellow mercenaries who were arrested in Zimbabwe in 2004 for attempting to topple Equatorial Guinea\u2019s despotic president, Teodoro Obiang. Mann and his friend Mark Thatcher admitted involvement in the attempted plot, which became known as the \u201cwonga coup\u201d. When the plot was revealed, Obiang threatened to eat Mann\u2019s testicles and drag his naked body through the streets. Mann served more than five years in two of the world\u2019s most notorious jails before being pardoned by Obiang himself. He had previously served in the Scots Guards and the SAS before setting up a number of security firms specialised in protecting oil installations. In March 2004 Mann, Nick du Toit and three other South African mercenaries plotted Obiang\u2019s overthrow with international financial backers and the tacit approval of at least three governments, most notably Spain. The coup involved flying into the former Spanish colony in a plane loaded with arms and more than 50 black \u201cBuffalo soldiers\u201d \u2013 former members of the now disbanded South African defence forces\u2019 elite 32 battalion\u2013 to replace Obiang with an exiled opposition activist called Severo Moto. In return, the plotters and their backers were hoping to tap into Equatorial Guinea\u2019s reserves of oil and natural gas. But their plane was intercepted by the Zimbabweans at Harare airport. A jubilant President Robert Mugabe threw Mann and his fellow conspirators into jail before handing them over to Equatorial Guinea where a court sentenced the mercenary to 34 years in jail. In a note sent out to his legal team while he was being held, Mann implicated Thatcher, whom he referred to by the name"

In his trial, Mann admitted he had been approach by Ely Calil, a Lebanese oil tycoon who was a friend of Moto, who regarded himself as head of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s government in exile. Thatcher was alleged to have paid for a helicopter to fly Moto from Equatorial Guinea during the planned coup. He was fined and given a four-year suspended sentence for his part in the coup after admitting breaking anti-mercenary legislation. But he claimed he was only unwittingly involved in the plot. In 2006 the plot was dramatised in Coup!, a TV movie written by the comic John Fortune. After his pardon, Mann returned to the UK. He was married three times and had nine children. MailOnline reported that he had died earlier this week while exercising in a gym."

The attorney, Tin Thanh Nguyen, told the news agency Reuters that his client, a Vietnamese construction worker from Los Angeles, was among the immigrants woken in the early morning hours and bussed from an immigration detention center in Pearsall, Texas, to an airfield where a military aircraft awaited them. After several hours, they were bussed back to the detention center around noon, the attorney said on Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon and the state department did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was first to report that the Trump administration was poised to deport immigrants held in the US to Libya, despite a court order against such a move, in a development that would escalate Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Officials earlier this week told Reuters the US military could fly the immigrants to the north African country as soon as Wednesday, but stressed that plans could change. A US official said the flight never departed. As of Friday, it was unclear if the administration was still planning to proceed with the deportations. A federal judge in Boston ruled on Wednesday that any effort by the Trump administration to deport non-Libyan immigrants to Libya without adequate screenings for possible persecution or torture would clearly violate a prior court order.

    "chunk": "Food rations for a million people in Uganda have been cut off completely this week amid a funding crisis at the United Nations World Food Programme, raising fears that refugees will now be pushed back into countries at war. The WFP in Uganda warned two weeks ago that $50m (\u00a337m) was urgently needed to help refugees and asylum seekers fleeing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Sudan. Uganda hosts Africa\u2019s largest refugee population of 1.8 million, with 60,000 new arrivals in the last three months. Malnutrition rates had reached a crisis point, said the UN agency. \u201cDue to severe funding shortages, @WFP_Uganda has cut 1 million refugees entirely off from food assistance,\u201d the agency announced via social media. \u201cMalnutrition has reached critical levels (15% +) in refugee reception centres, and general food rations have been cut by up to 80%,\u201d it said. In March, the WFP slashed food relief, introducing rationing for new arrivals to the east African country. Hillary Onek, Uganda\u2019s minister for refugees, said it was a direct result of the radical aid cuts by the US and European countries. Donald Trump\u2019s freeze on US aid spending in January and the UK\u2019s cut in aid spending the following month from 0.58% of gross national income to 0.3% have badly hit Uganda\u2019s ability to look after refugees. \u201cThe problem is beyond and outside our control. The global funding to support refugees has dwindled. The money given to the World Food Programme to buy food was cut off. The refugees are going to suffer the consequences,\u201d Onek said. \u201cAid can\u2019t be depended on any more. Trump came and radically cut off funds to support refugee programmes.

WFP and UNHCR are in a total crisis because of lack of funding,\u201d he said. Just 46% of the $858m required in the multi-agency Uganda Country Refugee Response Plan was funded in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for us now to shoulder the burden of refugee challenge alone.

They will go into people\u2019s cassava gardens, uproot them and that is war and confusion. We don\u2019t know how we shall overcome that impending confusion,\u201d he said.

Reuters cited three unnamed US officials as saying the deportations could happen this week. Two of the officials said the immigrants, whose nationalities are not known, could be flown to the north African country as soon as Wednesday, but they added the plans could still change. The New York Times also cited a US official confirming the deportation plans. The reported moves come as a federal judge ruled in favor of immigrant rights advocates, who asked him to block any deportation of immigrants to Libya. District court judge Brian Murphy agreed with advocates that a previous injunction he had issued already barred such flights. \u201cIf there is any doubt \u2013 the Court sees none \u2013 the allegedly imminent removals,\u201d Murphy clarified, \u201cwould clearly violate this Court\u2019s Order.\u201d It was not clear what Libya would be getting in return for taking any deportees. In a rare show of unity, Libya\u2019s rival governments have responded to news reports by saying that they would refuse to accept any deportees from the United States. Human rights groups condemned the reported plans, noting the country\u2019s poor record on human rights practices and harsh treatment of detainees. \u201cMigrants have long been trafficked, tortured and ransomed in Libya.

But Trump goes a step further. The American president claims ownership of this horror by deporting people to a hell that is Libya, flaunting his power. It is a move that drags our civilisation toward the abyss.\u2019\u2019 Libya\u2019s government of national unity said on Wednesday it rejected the use of its territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent. The government added there was no coordination with the US regarding the reception of migrants. Trump, who made immigration a major issue during his election campaign, has launched aggressive enforcement action since taking office, increasing troops to the southern border and pledging to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the US. As of Monday, the Trump administration had deported 152,000 people, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump\u2019s administration has tried to encourage migrants to leave voluntarily by threatening steep fines, trying to strip away legal status, and sending migrants to notorious prisons in Guant\u00e1namo Bay and El Salvador. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, last week said the US was not satisfied with sending migrants only to El Salvador, and hinted that Washington was looking to expand the number of countries to which it could deport people. \u201cWe are working with other countries to say: we want to send you some of the most despicable human beings; will you do this as a favour to us?\u201d Rubio said at a cabinet meeting at the White House"

The ICJ said it could not examine the claim because the UAE, a party to the genocide convention, had put in a reservation that prevented the ICJ adjudicating on claims that the UAE had breached the convention.

    "chunk": "Groups supporting clergy-molestation survivors say they are gravely concerned and insulted by the election of Pope Leo XIV after he overcame questions about his handling of clerical sexual abuse cases earlier in his career to become the Roman Catholic church\u2019s first-ever US-born leader. Before Robert Prevost\u2019s ascent to the papacy at age 69, he was leading a chapter of the Augustinian religious order in his home town of Chicago when allegations surfaced that a priest and Catholic high school principal under his jurisdiction had molested at least one student as well as kept child-abuse imagery. Prevost reportedly allowed that cleric to continue in his role despite the allegations, though the Augustinian order later paid a multimillion-dollar settlement to the abuse survivor and in December booted the priest from the order. Meanwhile, Prevost also did not impede another priest \u2013 whose ministry had been restricted in the wake of allegations that he abused minors \u2013 from living at an Augustinian residence that was near a Catholic elementary school. And, while serving as a bishop in Peru, Prevost heard from three women who accused two priests there of sexually abusing them as minors and have since claimed there is no evidence that much was done to investigate the cleric. That history prompted the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (Snap) to file a complaint against Prevost in March under church legislation implemented by the late Pope Francis that provided potential disciplinary measures against bishops who were found to have turned a blind eye to abuse of both children and adults considered vulnerable. The complaint did not prevent Leo from being elected on Thursday after a short conclave at the Vatican, which prompted Snap to quickly issue a statement expressing \u201cgrave concern about his record managing abuse cases\u201d. \u201cYou can end the"

During that time, claims reportedly surged that the principal of Providence Catholic high school in New Lenox, Illinois, which was part of Prevost\u2019s territory, had molested a student and possessed images of child abuse on his phone. Prevost \u2013 who was also the Augustinians\u2019 worldwide leader for 12 years beginning in 2001 \u2013 left the principal, an Augustinian priest named Richard McGrath, in his post, a decision he has not explained, as the Chicago Sun-Times has previously reported. McGrath retired in 2017 after being faced with an investigation into the claims against him. The abused student, Robert Krankvich, then sued in 2018. And in late 2023 the church agreed to pay him $2m \u2013 before Krankvich died in April at age 43. \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t bring happiness,\u201d Krankvich\u2019s father, also named Robert, said to the Sun-Times. \u201cIt gave him no closure.\u201d During Krankvich\u2019s lawsuit, McGrath declined to answer whether or not he possessed child abuse images, invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination, the Sun-Times reported. Yet McGrath denied molesting Krankvich and was kept off a list of alleged Augustinian abusers published in 2024, though he resigned in light of the claims against him.

Separately, in 2000 and still early in Prevost\u2019s stint as the midwestern US Augustinian chapter, the order stationed a member priest named James Ray in its St John Stone Friary in Chicago. The friary was adjacent to an elementary school, and since 1991, Ray was restricted from working around children because of accusations that he had molested minors. Survivors groups say those moves are not indicative of an organization doing everything it can to protect children. The Vatican has reportedly countered that Prevost was not the one who authorized Ray\u2019s living arrangements at the friary. Prevost subsequently spent eight years as the bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, beginning in 2015. According to a statement that they issued, three women told Prevost directly that they had allegedly been abused as minors by local priests named Eleuterio V\u00e1squez Gonz\u00e1lez and Ricardo Yesqu\u00e9n. But the women said they had no evidence any meaningful investigation into their claims ensued, and at one point they published several images showing V\u00e1squez publicly celebrating mass on important occasions such as Easter despite purported assurances to them that he was suspended from such ministry, as the National Catholic Reporter noted in reporting on a case rife with conflicting claims.

On Thursday, Republicans in the House of Representatives approved legislation to codify Donald Trump\u2019s policy of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \u201cGulf of America\u201d. The measure was sponsored by rightwing Georgia lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene and passed nearly along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican, with the exception of vulnerable Nebraska representative Don Bacon, voting in favor. The bill would make the name change official for federal agencies, but it\u2019s unlikely to attract the Democratic support needed to pass the Senate. Even if it did, other countries have no obligation to use the new name. Sheinbaum had warned Google, which is part of tech giant Alphabet, in February that she was considering legal action unless the company reversed its decision. Her government argues that Trump\u2019s executive order on the subject only applies to the part of the continental shelf belonging to the United States. \u201cAll we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,\u201d Sheinbaum said. \u201cThe US government only calls the portion of the US continental shelf the Gulf of America, not the entire gulf, because it wouldn\u2019t have the authority to name the entire gulf,\u201d she added.

The news prompted particular elation in Peru, where he lived and worked for more than 20 years and was granted citizenship in 2015. In the capital, Lima, the bells of the cathedral rang in celebration. In his first appearance from the Vatican balcony, Leo XIV briefly switched from Italian to Spanish to address the faithful \u201cfrom my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru\u201d, where he served as bishop for more than a decade. Peru\u2019s president, Dina Boluarte, hailed the \u201chistoric\u201d election of Leo XIV, whom she described as a Peruvian \u201cby choice and conviction\u201d who had devoted more than 20 years of service to the country. She added that Prevost, 69, \u201cchose to be one of us, to live among us and to carry in his heart the faith, culture and dreams of this country\u201d. She added: \u201cThe pope is Peruvian; God loves Peru.\u201d Even so, Prevost has spoken out against Boluarte\u2019s government in the past. In early 2023, he described his \u201csadness and pain\u201d over the deaths of 49 protesters in anti-government demonstrations that erupted when President Boluarte took office in December 2022, replacing Pedro Castillo who was forced out for attempting to suspend congress. At the time Prevost said the unrest reflected the historic neglect of Peru\u2019s poor, saying: \u201cThis conflict does not represent the best of the country.\u201d Pope Leo also called on late former president Alberto Fujimori, who was jailed in 2009 for human rights abuses and corruption to ask for forgiveness from each of his government\u2019s victims in order to begin a process of reconciliation.

Prevost pointedly suggested \u201cit would be more effective to ask for forgiveness, personally, for some of the great injustices that were committed and for which he was tried and sentenced\u201d. The controversial ex-leader was sent back to jail in 2018, only to be pardoned again in 2023 amid street protests. He died in 2024 and was given a state funeral. Rosa Mar\u00eda V\u00edlchez, 49, who is originally from Chiclayo but now lives in Lima, met Prevost when attending a church service a few years ago. \u201cWe knew him by name,\u201d she recalls. \u201cToday I remembered that when I saw him and I really felt like crying because he moved me.

He returned in 1988, spending the following decade as head of the Augustinian seminary in Trujillo, the country\u2019s third most populous city, also in the north, where he taught canon law and served as a judge on the regional ecclesiastical court. He returned to the US in 1998 and was elected provincial of the Augustinian province of Chicago. He did not return to Peru until 2014 when Pope Francis appointed him as apostolic administrator of the diocese of Chiclayo. The following year, he was named bishop of the city.

Just before his death, Pope Francis dissolved Sodalitium, after a 50-year history of sexual, psychological and physical abuse, and allegations of malfeasance and corruption.

US district judge Paula Xinis disclosed the government\u2019s position in a two-page order on Wednesday. She set a Monday deadline for attorneys to file briefs on the issue and how it could affect \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda\u2019s case. Xinis also scheduled a 16 May hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland, to address the matter. The Republican administration previously invoked the same legal authority to cut off a judge\u2019s inquiry into whether it defied an order to turn around planes deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, 29, has been imprisoned in his native El Salvador for nearly two months. His mistaken deportation has become a flash point for Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and his increasing friction with the US courts. Trump has said he could call El Salvador\u2019s president and have \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, who was living in Maryland, returned to the United States. Instead, Trump has doubled down on his claims that \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda is a member of the MS-13 gang. Police in Maryland had identified \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda as an MS-13 gang member in 2019 based off his tattoos, Chicago Bulls hoodie and the word of a criminal informant. But \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was never charged. His lawyers say the informant claimed \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was in an MS-13 chapter in New York, where \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has never lived. The administration has balked at telling Xinis what, if anything, it has done to facilitate \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda\u2019s return to the US.

    "chunk": "A new peer-reviewed scientific study has found no evidence of a mystery brain disease in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, suggesting instead a troubling combination of \u201cmisdiagnosis and misinformation\u201d. The research comes as the Maritime province prepares its own assessment of more than 220 suspected cases in the hope of giving families some answers to a medical mystery that has gripped the region for years. The report published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, known as Jama, is an independent reassessment of 25 cases diagnosed by Moncton-based neurologist Alier Marrero from within the broader sample of 222 patients. The authors, affiliated with the University of Toronto, New Brunswick\u2019s Horizon health network and other Canadian institutions, found that those within the cohort were misdiagnosed and had common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, functional neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury and metastatic cancer. The findings, however, are unlikely to tamp down speculation from families that the report once again ignores their suspicions of environmental contamination in the region. Health officials in New Brunswick first warned in 2021 that more than 40 residents were suffering from a possible unknown neurological syndrome, with symptoms similar to those of the degenerative brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Those cases were referred to Marrero after the initial physicians were initially stumped by the symptoms displayed by their parents. A year later, however, an independent oversight committee created by the province determined that the group of patients had most likely been misdiagnosed and were suffering from known illnesses such as cancer and dementia. A final report from the committee, which concluded there was no \u201ccluster\u201d of people suffering from an unknown brain syndrome, signalled the end of the province\u2019s investigation.

    "chunk": "Scorpions are \u201ctaking over\u201d Brazilian cities, researchers have warned in a paper that said rapid urbanisation and climate breakdown were driving an increase in the number of people being stung. More than 1.1m stings were reported between 2014 and 2023, according to data from the Brazilian notifiable diseases information system. There was a 155% increase in reports of stings from 2014 to 2023, according to research published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health. The rise in cases has been driven by rapid, unplanned urbanisation \u2013 such as favelas \u2013 characterised by high-density housing and poor waste disposal, according to the research. Although urban areas are encroaching on wild habitats where scorpions already live, they are also creating new environments in which to thrive. \u201cUrbanisation in Brazil has profoundly reshaped ecosystems,\u201d said the lead researcher, Manuela Berto Pucca, an assistant professor at S\u00e3o Paulo State University. \u201cCities unintentionally offer everything scorpions need: plenty of shelter (in walls, drains, rubble and construction debris), consistent warmth, and a reliable food supply in the form of cockroaches and other urban invertebrates.\u201d They particularly like sewers, which are warm year-round, home to almost no predators and provide plenty of food, especially cockroaches. Some species of scorpion can survive for up to 400 days without food and are able to reproduce without mating, making them difficult to eradicate. Hotter summers, and periods of intense rainfall and drought, also help them thrive as they are adapted to warm and humid environments. Provisional data for 2024 suggests scorpions were responsible for nearly 200,000 stings and 133 deaths in Brazil. In total, researchers projected 2m new cases between 2025 and 2033. \u201cThe real scale of this issue is likely far greater than the recorded statistics suggest,\u201d researchers said, as many people choose to treat themselves at home, or"

Healthy people generally make a full recovery, but can suffer from pain and discomfort for several days. Symptoms include pain, burning, swelling, redness, tingling and nausea. Previous research modelling the distribution of scorpions in Brazil showed the potential to expand their habitats into urban areas driven by a warmer, wetter climate. Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, Mexico, Guyana and Venezuela have witnessed a \u201cparticularly alarming rise in scorpionism [the medical condition resulting from a sting] over recent decades, evolving into a significant public health crisis\u201d, the researchers of the new study said.

Top US officials are expected to meet a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first significant talks between the two nations since Trump provoked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports. The US president wrote \u201c80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B\u201d on his social media account on Friday morning, referring to Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary. Bessent and Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, will meet their counterparts in Geneva in the most senior known conversations between the two countries in months, the Trump administration announced this week. It comes amid growing US market concern over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods. No country has been hit harder by Trump\u2019s trade war than China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter and second largest economy. When the US president announced his \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs on 2 April, China retaliated with tariffs of its own, a move that Trump viewed as demonstrating a lack of respect. The tariffs on each other\u2019s goods have been mounting since then, with the US tariffs against China now at 145% and China tariffs on the US at 125%.

Bessent and the trade representative Jamieson Greer are due to meet the Chinese vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Switzerland on Saturday and Sunday, marking the first talks between the superpowers since Trump unveiled his tariffs.

    "chunk": "Taiwan\u2019s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries heading for conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a punchy speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe. \u201cEighty years after the end of the European war, the message of history is clear. Today, 80 years later, we share the same values \u200b\u200band face similar challenges as many of the democracies that participated in the European war,\u201d Lai said to a group of foreign dignitaries gathered in Taipei. Lai\u2019s speech comes at a time when Taiwan is facing increasing military pressure from China. It is the first time Taiwan has officially commemorated the end of the second world war in Europe. The conflict is a thorny topic in cross-strait relations. China at the time was ruled by the Kuomintang, or the nationalists, under the banner of the Republic of China. During the war, the Kuomintang fought alongside the Chinese Communist party (CCP) against the Japanese, before resuming their own civil conflict, which led to the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 and establishing the Republic of China there. This remains the island\u2019s official name. The CCP established the People\u2019s Republic of China in Beijing. In a veiled reference to China, Lai called on \u201cfreedom-loving people and countries\u201d to work together to counter authoritarian regimes. \u201cTaiwan and Europe are jointly facing the threat of a new totalitarian group,\u201d Lai said. \u201cThe bitter experience of world war two tells us that appeasement will only make the invaders more greedy and expand their ambitions.\u201d Thursday\u2019s event opened with a short video featuring clips of the D-day landings in Normandy and audio recordings of Winston Churchill\u2019s famous \u201cWe shall fight on the beaches\u201d speech.

The top British representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, spoke at the event, as did Lutz G\u00fcllner, the head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan. Marcin Jerzewski, the head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security Policy, said Lai was \u201ctrying to send the message that security and prosperity of Taiwan and Europe are still interconnected, so that European partners fearing possible withdrawal of American security guarantees from Europe don\u2019t turn away from their engagements with the Indo-Pacific and security in the Taiwan Strait\u201d. Lai is steering Taiwan through a fraught geopolitical moment. The self-governing island is claimed by China, which has vowed to annex it with the use of force if necessary. Since Donald Trump took office as US president in January, the commitment of the US, Taiwan\u2019s main security backer, to helping Taiwan defend itself has been unclear. China frequently rehearses blockades of Taiwan. So-called \u201cgrey zone\u201d tactics such as disinformation campaigns have been increasing.

After nearly four hours of talks, Xi described his meeting with his Russian counterpart as \u201cin-depth, friendly and fruitful\u201d. Calling Xi a \u201cdear friend\u201d, Putin said the talks were \u201cwarm and substantive\u201d and ties between Russia and China were stronger than ever before.

The two leaders presented a united front in opposition to a US-led global order they openly reject. Their display of solidarity comes as Donald Trump, the US president, wages a trade war against China and pushes Russia toward peace talks over Ukraine.

On Thursday, a three-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine declared by Russia came into effect, though Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of continuing hostilities.

    "chunk": "Korean beauty products are moving from phone screens to UK high streets as social media drives sales of skincare with the help of eye-catching ingredients such as snail slime and salmon sperm. Retailers are looking to capitalise on the TikTok and Instagram trend for skincare and makeup ranges from South Korea \u2013 known as K-beauty \u2013 by opening physical stores and launching brands in a push to get consumers to pick up products that havegone viral online. While some of the ranges have been available on specialist beauty websites for some time, British shoppers are now getting the chance to try them out on their skin and assess their supposed wondrous effects. The trend is another example of South Korea\u2019s growing cultural prominence where food, film, TV and K-pop, with its international stars such as the boyband BTS, are becoming big business as companies expand into large consumer markets such as Britain. K-beauty\u2019s positive reputation stems in part from Korea\u2019s tradition of using natural substances in products, making them gentle on the skin, and its strict rules around labelling. The industry is also known for novel formulations and unexpected packaging (sometimes animal-shaped), although many shoppers discover brands such as Beauty of Joseon and Laneige through reviews by influencers. Georgia Stafford, of the market research firm Mintel, says: \u201cSocial media is the driving force behind K-beauty\u2019s popularity in the UK, where 34% of users have bought a beauty or grooming product after seeing it on social media, rising to 58% of Gen Z users.\u201d A fifth (21%) of Gen Z consumers (aged 13-28) use K-beauty products, according to Mintel, compared with 8% overall.

K-beauty products have previously had a \u201crelatively limited audience\u201d, according to Stafford, as they were unavailable on most high streets. However, online popularity could now translate to in-person purchases. Shoppers can now buy products such as Cosrx\u2019s skin essence containing snail mucin \u2013 slime to the uninitiated \u2013 at Superdrug and Boots. The latter store also sells Anua\u2019s face serum with PDRN (polydeoxyribonucleotide), which contains DNA fragments extracted from salmon sperm and is claimed to hydrate the skin deeply. K-beauty products are \u201ctypically a fraction of the cost\u201d compared with those from established premium brands, says Stafford. \u201cExperimenting with new products and ingredients is therefore accessible to consumers. PDRN is a standout example.

    "chunk": "People showing symptoms of endometriosis should be offered diagnosis options such as ultrasound so they receive treatment sooner, according to updated guidelines. Endometriosis can take years to be diagnosed, as it has previously meant waiting for a surgical procedure to make the diagnosis. The condition can cause severe pain, infertility and heavy periods \u2013 and occurs when cells similar to the lining of the uterus grow in other parts of the body. As well as women, endometriosis also affects other people with a uterus and a small number of men. The living evidence guideline for endometriosis, published on Saturday by Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog), recommends that a transvaginal ultrasound be used as the first-line investigation or, if not appropriate, a pelvic MRI. The recommendations are based on emerging evidence suggesting that a greater number of cases can be diagnosed with these non-invasive techniques with increasing accuracy. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The guideline replaces the first clinical practice guidelines published by Ranzcog in 2021. A \u201cliving\u201d guideline means recommendations are updated based on the latest research and emerging evidence. Historically, the gold standard of diagnosing endometriosis was to take tissue from a patient during an operation and review it under a microscope. But research from a variety of groups shows ultrasound can detect deep infiltrating endometriosis with \u201cexcellent\u201d sensitivity, said Dr Marilla Druitt, a guideline developer. However this method does have limitations to detect superficial disease, she said. While a traditional ultrasound looks at uterus, tubes and ovaries, a new Medicare item number for an endometriosis ultrasound will become available from November which will look for endometriosis tissue in places outside the uterus, including the ligament that holds the uterus to the inside of someone\u2019s pelvis. \u201cThat Medicare item number"

But in order for more patients with endometriosis to access it, more sonographers will need to gain accreditation, she said. Offering ultrasound first to diagnose endometriosis means patients don\u2019t have to endure long wait lists for surgery before they can start accessing treatments, whether for sub-fertility or persistent pain. The guidelines recommend starting \u201cwith treatment and diagnosis in a parallel fashion, so there is absolutely no reason to delay treatment, which is the problem\u201d, Druitt said. The guidelines will also support GPs to begin first-line hormonal treatment while diagnostic investigations are under way, with primary care specific resources to improve access to key evidence-based recommendations. Prof Danielle Mazza, the head of the department of general practice at Monash University and member of the guideline development group, said \u201chaving clear, evidence-based tools like the quick reference guide and flowchart will be a gamechanger for primary care\u201d. The guidelines also now recommend physiotherapy and psychology care as potentially useful for people with pelvic pain and endometriosis.

New resources for patients have also been developed. Alexis Wolfe, consumer liaison on the guideline development group, said the resources will give people information that would help them advocate for themselves and participate more confidently in decision-making with care providers.

With Creative Australia holding fast to its decision to cancel its commission of artist Khaled Sabsabi and curator Michael Dagostino, it\u2019s becoming increasingly likely that the Australian Pavilion might remain dark in 2026. It is an added weight for the First Nations team who have unveiled their new creation inside the pavilion as part of Venice\u2019s other biennale: the Venice Biennale of Architecture, held every other year in the Giardini. The seven designers, collectively working under the moniker The Creative Sphere, are the first all Indigenous team Australia has sent to Venice. Tasked with introducing Indigenous concepts of building, design and connection to Country to the world, they have painstakingly reconstructed their rammed-earth, 4.8 metre by nine metre prototype called Home, first created at the University of Sydney.

After the Reserve Bank reduced borrowing rates in February, a quarter-of-a-percentage point cut in the cash rate on 20 May is deemed a sure thing, and would lower the key rate to 3.85%, from 4.1%.

Flights from the UK to Bosnia and Herzegovina soared by 284% in 2024 compared with the previous year, while trips to Montenegro increased by 164%. Getaways to Albania \u2013 billed by some as \u201cthe new Croatia\u201d \u2013 rose by 61%, according to an analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data.

The travel blogger Tara Tadlock, who has nearly 15,000 followers on Instagram, said the trend was inspired by a post-Covid burst of adventure as well as the cost of living crisis, as holidaymakers hunt for bargains. \u201cIn the summer months accommodation prices spike \u2026 some restaurants will change their menus and charge extra,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cost of living is a huge driver.

Experts spotted that influencers were sharing \u201cduplicate destinations\u201d in a similar way to imitations of designer clothing, another TikTok trend. It is not just gen Z travellers broadening their horizons, however. The CAA figures showed that millennials and their parents made up the bulk of the passengers heading to the Balkans. Under-25s comprised one in five of those arriving in Albania and 13% of those flying to Montenegro. The increased demand for lesser-known destinations is also explained by Covid-19, which experts believe changed how many people travel. While visits to tourist hotspots have bounced back \u2013 in part driven by an urge to tick off bucket list locations \u2013 other holidaymakers are avoiding the crowds. Research by Expedia found that 76% of boomers \u2013 born between 1946 and 1964 \u2013 prioritise quieter places compared with gen Z (40%).

Voters in the central European country will cast their verdict on a government bill that details the conditions and terms under which certain artists can claim an allowance to be added to their pensions. For the referendum law to be rejected, at least one-fifth of all eligible voters among Slovenia\u2019s population of 2.12 million must vote \u201cno\u201d. The number of \u201cno\u201d votes must also represent more than half of all votes cast. The bill, which passed parliament in January, has been prepared by the culture ministry that is held by the leader of the eco-socialist Left party, Asta Vre\u010dko. The government \u2013 comprised of a coalition of the Freedom Movement, Social Democrats and Left parties \u2013 says it is enacting an overdue reform of special pension provisions for persons of merit that dates back to 1974, when Slovenia was one of the republics of Yugoslavia, by tying them to stricter criteria rather than leaving them at the mercy of the personal tastes of whichever politician holds the culture ministry. Leading in the polls a year before national elections, however, the conservative Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) has found in the relatively technical tweak to a 50-year-old law a rich seam for a culture war against perceived cultural elites. The referendum was initiated by the party, which is led by Janez Jan\u0161a, a former prime minister.

Under the new criteria proposed by the government, the combination of these awards would entitle Smrekar to a pension top-up equalling 50% of the difference between her existing pension and the highest one calculated from the pension base for 40 years of service.

An SDS spokesperson said: \u201cMeanwhile, more than half of all pensioners live below the poverty line.\u201d The divisive referendum campaign is taking place against the backdrop of a broader pension reform embarked on by the government of Robert Golob, the prime minister, at the urging of the European Commission, which will lead to a rise in the retirement age from 60 years to 62 for those who have worked 40 years. The government says that while its bill would initially lead to a surge of special pensions for artists on a waiting list, the overall burden on taxpayers would eventually stabilise at a lower cost than under the old law. Of the 83 artists receiving special pensions for artists in Slovenia, 33 are next-of-kin who inherited it from the original recipient under the rules of original 1974 law. The revised bill would scrap the inheritance rule. Slovenia\u2019s national electoral commission has calculated the cost of the referendum on the bill could amount to about \u20ac6.6m. \u201cThe referendum is being abused as an election campaign, and a very costly one at that\u201d, Vre\u010dko, the culture minister, told the Guardian."

The 39-year-old Dutch diver died on Friday while working underwater in preparation to cut the ship\u2019s mainmast. According to initial reports, the man was employed by the maritime company Hebo, whose barge arrived last week in Porticello, a fishing port near Palermo, where marine salvage experts have been carrying out preparatory work before an operation to raise the 56-metre superyacht. Police said the precise cause of death was still unknown. A preliminary examination of the body revealed no visible injuries or burns. Investigators believe the diver may have suffered a medical problem while submerged. An alternative line of inquiry is that after divers used a blowtorch to cut the vessel\u2019s boom the man was struck by dislodged debris \u2013 possibly a piece of metal. Footage captured by underwater cameras cut off shortly before the incident. A spokesperson for the British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which will oversee a consortium of expert salvage specialists undertaking the project, said: \u201cWe are saddened to confirm the tragic death of a specialist diver while doing underwater work earlier today [Friday]. The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by the authorities and all parties are offering their full cooperation. We are giving every support to the salvage team on site at this heartbreaking time and our thoughts are with the family of the deceased.\u201d On 19 August 2024, the luxury vessel, with a 75-metre (246ft) mast, was anchored just off shore near Porticello when it was struck shortly before dawn by a violent storm.

Lynch, who in June last year was cleared of fraud charges in the US relating to the purchase of his company, Autonomy, by Hewlett-Packard in 2011, was enjoying a lavish voyage around Sicily to celebrate his acquittal alongside Hannah and his wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian. Among those onboard were Lynch\u2019s attorney from Clifford Chance, Chris Morvillo, and his wife, the jewellery designer Neda Morvillo, and Morgan Stanley International\u2019s chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, a former psychotherapist. All four died in the incident. The yacht\u2019s chef, Recaldo Thomas, was the seventh person who died. Fifteen people survived, including Bacares. The wreckage sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello, which is under surveillance by Italian authorities. Insurers estimate the salvage will cost about $30m (\u00a323m), a bill the Bayesian\u2019s underwriters will pick up. The Italian coastguard, which is supervising operations and patrolling the security perimeter, said the overall operation to recover the Bayesian could take from 20 to 25 days, weather permitting."

Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister who served as the EU\u2019s top diplomat from 2019 to 2024, and president of the European parliament from 2004 to 2007, also criticised the bloc\u2019s failure to use all the means at its disposal to influence Israel, saying expressions of regret were simply not enough. As he collected the Charles V European award in front of dignitaries including King Felipe in south-west Spain on Friday, Borrell said the horrors Israel had suffered in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 could not justify the horrors it had subsequently inflicted on Gaza. \u201cWe\u2019re facing the largest ethnic cleansing operation since the end of the second world war in order to create a splendid holiday destination once all the millions of tonnes of rubble have been cleared from Gaza and the Palestinians have died or gone away,\u201d he said in a characteristically direct speech. \u200bThe former diplomat accused Israel of violating all the rules of conflict and of using the starvation of Gaza\u2019s civilian population as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d. \u201cThree times more explosive power has been dropped on Gaza than was used in the Hiroshima bomb,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for months now, nothing has been getting into Gaza. Nothing: no water, no food, no electricity, no fuel, no medical services. That\u2019s what [Benjamin] Netanyau\u2019s ministers have said and it\u2019s what they\u2019ve done.\u201d He added: \u201cWe all know what\u2019s going on there, and we\u2019ve all heard the objectives stated by Netanyau\u2019s ministers\u200b, which are clear declarations of genocidal intent.

Seldom have I heard the leader of a state so clearly outline a plan that fits the legal definition of genocide.\u201d Borrell went on to take Europe to task for shirking its moral and humanitarian responsibilities over Gaza. \u201cEurope has the capacity and the means not only to protest against what is going on but also to influence [Israel\u2019s] conduct,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not doing so. We supply half the bombs that are falling on Gaza.

    "chunk": "Aid groups have voiced alarm at US moves to pressure them into accepting an Israeli proposal to resume limited humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory under strictly controlled conditions. The Trump administration has attempted to strong-arm international agencies \u2013 including the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme (WFP) \u2013 into accepting Israel\u2019s stringent rules for resuming deliveries, according to sources familiar with the discussions and news reports. A two-month blockade has left the coastal enclave\u2019s 2.3 million inhabitants facing the prospect of starvation. The blockade was imposed by the Israel Defense Forces in March after the collapse of a ceasefire to the conflict that broke out after Hamas\u2019s October 2023 attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel. So far, more than 52,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel\u2019s military response. Under the auspices of a newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is based in Geneva, aid would be delivered to four \u201chubs\u201d, where recipients would have to go to collect it under the watchful gaze of private US security contractors, who would use facial recognition technology to vet who receives it. Israel insists the stringent measures are necessary to prevent aid being stolen or diverted to Hamas, although some assistance organizations have said they have seen no evidence of such practices. Aid groups have so far refused to participate in the scheme, fearing it violates \u201cfundamental humanitarian principles\u201d and breaches international law. Some have privately voiced concerns about potential \u201ccomplicity in war crimes because of how the aid will be distributed\u201d, according to one person in close contact with assistance organizations, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cThere is a concern that this aid plan risks enabling war crimes related to forced displacement, starvation and internment,\u201d the person said. \u201cThis is a scheme to make it seem"

Even if aid is resumed, some groups say, the conditions Israel is stipulating will prevent it reaching many of those in need. \u201cIf you centralize, privatize and militarize aid delivery through this proposed hub model, it means that people will be excluded from getting humanitarian assistance,\u201d said Joseph Belliveau, executive director of MedGlobal, which has been providing medical assistance \u2013 including to severely malnourished children \u2013 at 16 sites in Gaza. \u201cPeople simply won\u2019t be able to come to these distribution sites, either because of fear, logistical constraints, or distance.

    "chunk": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday granted a judge\u2019s order to bring a Turkish Tufts University student from a Louisiana immigration detention center back to New England for hearings to determine whether her rights were violated. A judicial panel of the New York-based US second circuit court of appeals ruled in the case of R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk after lawyers representing her and the US justice department presented arguments at a hearing on Tuesday. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk has been detained in Louisiana for six weeks following an op-ed she cowrote last year that criticized the school\u2019s response to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. The court ordered \u00d6zt\u00fcrk to be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody in Vermont no later than 14 May. A district court judge in Vermont had earlier ordered that the 30-year-old doctoral student be brought to the state for hearings to determine whether she was illegally detained. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s lawyers say her detention violates her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process. The justice department, which appealed that ruling, said that an immigration court in Louisiana has jurisdiction over her case. Immigration officials surrounded \u00d6zt\u00fcrk as she walked along a street in a Boston suburb on 25 March and drove her to New Hampshire and Vermont before putting her on a plane to a detention center in Basile, Louisiana. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, the Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university\u2019s response to student activists demanding that Tufts \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide\u201d, disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s lawyers say she has suffered from asthma attacks and received poor medical care while being detained. \u201cR\u00fcmeysa has suffered six weeks in crowded confinement without adequate access to medical care and in conditions that doctors say"

An early morning strike on another school turned shelter in Gaza City killed 16 people, according to officials at al-Ahli hospital, while strikes on targets in other areas killed at least 16 others. Aid agencies have criticised Israeli plans to take over distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza and use private companies to get food to Palestinians after two months in which the military has prevented supplies from entering the territory. It comes as Gaza has been hit by a wave of looting and theft as increasingly desperate Palestinians struggle to get food while criminal gangs exploit a breakdown in law and order. Medical officials in Gaza report rising cases of acute malnutrition, and community kitchens that served 1m meals a day are shutting down for lack of basic essentials. Aid agencies say they have distributed all remaining stocks of food. \u201cBy the time a famine is declared, it will be too late. The crime wave is because you have 2 million or more desperate, traumatised people packed together with virtually no policing,\u201d said one humanitarian official in Gaza.

Share Humanitarian situation in Gaza 'critical', says France's Macron French president Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that the humanitarian situation in Gaza had reached \u201ccritical\u201d levels unseen in the past and that it was urgent to allow the distribution of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Macron also said that while Israel was entitled to fight a terrorist organisation, it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d it acted without respecting any rules. Israel announced plans on Monday to take over the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza as part of an expanded operation it says could include seizing the entire Gaza Strip. Share"

Veldkamp described the Israeli ban on the supply of aid into Gaza as \u201ccatastrophic, truly dismal\u201d and in clear breach of international humanitarian law. He has written to the head of the European Union foreign service Kaja Kallas requesting an urgent review, saying he believes Israel is now in breach of the association agreement. Veldkamp, a former Dutch ambassador to Israel, said he expects the issue to be discussed at a two day informal EU foreign ministers meeting in Poland starting Wednesday. The EU is Israel\u2019s largest trade partner. The Dutch government has in the past led moves to block discussion of the association agreement\u2019s suspension, a lever most persistently advocated by Ireland and Spain. Explaining his position Veldkamp said: \u201cYou cannot starve the people of the Gaza Strip. It is against international law. It\u2019s morally wrong. It\u2019s dangerous. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Israel\u2019s own interest.\u201d Chances for a ceasefire appeared \u201cvery, very slim,\u201d he said, making the situation \u201cunbearable\u201d. The Dutch government would veto any extension of the EU-Israel action plan, the agreement implementing the association agreement that came into force in 2000, he added. Article 2 of the EU-Israel association agreement stipulates that their relations are based on respect for human rights and democratic principles. NGOs have repeatedly pressed a divided EU to take a stronger stand, but no moves were made to suspend the agreement in its meeting with Israel this February. In his letter to Kallas, Veldkamp said Israel\u2019s proposed system of aid distribution appeared incompatible with the \u201cprinciples of neutrality,"

Speaking to Geo News after the counter-attack began, Ishaq Dar, the foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said Pakistan had been left with no choice but to retaliate. \u201cThere was no other option because India showed no sincerity in response to the diplomatic efforts made by friendly countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe acted only after India continued firing drones and missiles.\u201d The fighting this week was first inflamed on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were in response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which they blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists. The situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks. India claimed to have intercepted more than 400 drones targeting cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday. In retaliation, India said it had launched four drone strikes at Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure. In the aftermath of Pakistan\u2019s strikes, tensions remained high across India.

The building in which they sat was a Quaker meeting house, the home of a movement whose centuries-long history is rooted in protest and a commitment to social justice. On the table were cups of jasmine tea, ginger biscuits and a selection of vegan cheese straws. But the events that brought this apparently convivial gathering to an abrupt end have sparked protests of a different kind and raised questions about how justice is administered by the UK\u2019s largest and most embattled police force. Talk among the youth activists that evening had turned to the 1963 Children\u2019s March in Birmingham, Alabama, when a flash of blue light interrupted the chatter. Seconds later up to 30 Metropolitan police officers, some armed with stun guns, smashed down the door of the Grade II-listed building and arrested the young women inside. One of the six, 18-year-old Zahra Ali, was held in a cell for 17 hours. Another was \u201crear stacked\u201d, hands cuffed behind her back and held against the wall in what she described as an hour-long ordeal. Phones were seized and laptops bagged as evidence. The raid, described as \u201cintelligence-led\u201d, was targeting the protest group Youth Demand. The members in attendance were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. Five remain under investigation. Six weeks on, the operation has drawn criticism from religious groups, politicians and activists. The need for such a severe course of action, meted out in a place of worship, remains a concern, not least for those who were targeted. \u201cI was the last one to be taken into custody,\u201d said Ali, the youngest of the six women. \u201cI got to"

It\u2019s not just because I soaked them overnight and have now simmered them for about an hour: more than 12 years has gone into the creation and production of these beans. After all that, they had better taste delicious. These beans are the creation of Prof Eric Holub, a geneticist and researcher at the University of Warwick, who has spent more than a decade developing three new varieties of beans, engineered to be grown in the UK. The three varieties of UK Registered Beans, or URBeans, are named Olivia, Godiva and Capulet, inspired by the Warwickshire region. They are the offspring of previous work by Holub, who has also developed rot-resistant alfalfa. He used mechanical pollination, by which pollen is transferred between two parent plants to create genetically optimised offspring. It might sound a bit sci-fi, but Holub assures me that these aren\u2019t frightening beans. \u201cThere was nothing novel about the technology we used for this initiative, it\u2019s been used for hundreds of years.

The Eat-Lancet report recommending a shift to plant-based diets was years away, and knowledge about beans was stuck at beans on toast.\u201d Now 23.4% of Britons consider themselves flexitarians while the focus on ultra-processed foods has made consumers more conscious about the contents of their \u201chealthy\u201d food and encouraged greater mindfulness about how food gets to our plates.

And they taste good. The mixture of Olivia and Godiva has an unexpected depth of flavour, a Pinto-esque nuttiness that worked well with the smoky tomato, lemon and garlic sauce I put together, and I felt strangely accomplished having made the beans as from-scratch as I could. It sounds a bit hippy, but really understanding where these little legumes came from and how they made it to my plate did add to the enjoyment of the meal.

However, the terms and conditions show a number of limitations. Ads for the new membership scheme boast \u201cfree reserved seats\u201d but this is limited to free reservations only on specially designated seats. If there are none left, members have to take a randomly allocated seat or if they want to choose a different seat, they will be charged (minus what the Prime seat costs).

The airline promises access to \u201c12 member-only seat sales\u201d but the details of how these differ from the regular seats sales Ryanair offers are unclear. The current membership sale for May promises \u201c\u00a350 off return flights\u201d. The discounted fares are only available to people who hold the membership, the T&Cs state, and members have to be over 18.

    "chunk": "Aphids are plaguing gardeners this spring due to the warm weather, with higher numbers of the rose-killing bugs expected to thrive in the UK as a result of climate breakdown. The sap-sucking insects have topped the ranking of gardener queries to the Royal Horticultural Society, with many of its 600,000 members having complained of dozens of aphids on their acers, roses and honeysuckle plants. They thrive in warm, dry weather, exacerbated by climate breakdown. Additionally, they can be killed off by frost, and the change in weather patterns is making frost less regular. Hayley Jones, the principal entomologist at the RHS, said: \u201cClimate change and more pronounced warm spells in many parts of the country could be a boon for some of the 500 species of aphid found in the UK, but there are other factors at play, including predator populations, the effect of climate change on general plant health and temperature swings and extremes.\u201d Aphids are also spreading to plants they never used to feed on in the UK. The RHS is calling on gardeners to support research into an aphid that has only recently affected buddleia, causing distinctive distortion to the leaves. It is asking the public to submit information on the RHS website to help map its spread. There are more than 500 species of aphid found in UK gardens, and they are commonly known as blackfly, greenfly and plant lice. They can be red, yellow, black, green, brown or pink insects and feed by sucking sap from plants. They can significantly harm their host plants, causing death in some circumstances, but also cause distorted growth, sooty mould and can transmit plant viruses. Aphids, despite causing annoyance to many gardeners, are an important part of the garden food chain, and are fed on by birds, earwigs, ladybirds"

Aphids, despite causing annoyance to many gardeners, are an important part of the garden food chain, and are fed on by birds, earwigs, ladybirds and other larger insects. However, when their population booms and there are not enough predators, they can get out of control and cause visible damage to plants. This is happening this spring, the RHS says, which recommends manual removal while predator numbers catch up. The charity is also finding environmentally friendly ways to manage aphids as does not recommend using harmful pesticides. One RHS trial involves growing poached egg plant (Limnanthes douglasii) alongside cabbages to determine if this encourages predatory hoverfly larvae, and installing earwig shelters in the RHS Garden Wisley orchard. The results are expected next year and, if successful, the RHS will encourage widespread use of these methods. Jones added: \u201cAphid biology means they are well-placed to make the most of a warm spring; aphids are a bit like Russian dolls, being born pregnant with the next generation so their populations can bloom rapidly. \u201cUnderstanding how they can be managed through simple planting choices or encouragement of natural predators will help minimise damage and potential plant losses while maintaining a healthy garden ecosystem.\u201d"

In an open letter to Keir Starmer, a host of major artists claim creatives\u2019 livelihoods are under threat as wrangling continues over a government plan to let artificial intelligence companies use copyright-protected work without permission. Describing copyright as the \u201clifeblood\u201d of their professions, the letter warns Starmer that the proposed legal change will threaten Britain\u2019s status as a leading creative power. \u201cWe will lose an immense growth opportunity if we give our work away at the behest of a handful of powerful overseas tech companies and with it our future income, the UK\u2019s position as a creative powerhouse, and any hope that the technology of daily life will embody the values and laws of the United Kingdom,\u201d the letter says. The letter urges the government to accept an amendment to the data bill proposed by Beeban Kidron, the cross-bench peer and leading campaigner against the copyright proposals. Kidron, who organised the artists\u2019 letter, is seeking a change that requires AI firms tell copyright owners which individual works they have ingested into their models. Urging parliamentarians on all sides of the political spectrum and in both houses to support the change, the letter says: \u201cWe urge you to vote in support of the UK creative industries. Supporting us supports the creators of the future. Our work is not yours to give away.\u201d Spanning the worlds of music, theatre, film, literature, art and media, the more than 400 signatories include Elton John, Kazuo Ishiguro, Annie Lennox, Rachel Whiteread, Jeanette Winterson, the National Theatre and the News Media"

Kidron\u2019s amendment will go to a House of Lords vote on Monday, although the government has already signalled its opposition to the change, saying that a consultation process already under way was the correct process for debating alterations to copyright law, which protects someone\u2019s work from being used by others without permission. Under the government proposal, AI companies will be able to use copyright-protected material without permission unless the copyright holder \u201copts out\u201d of the process by indicating \u2013 in an as yet unspecified way \u2013 that they do not wish their work to be used for free.

But the specifics of his alternative \u2013 exactly how his administration claims it will make America great again \u2013 change by the day. The US president declared this week to be a key milestone of his second term, as he unveiled his first major trade deal since returning to office following accelerated talks with the UK. But it came as Trump\u2019s position, on everything from tariffs on strollers and movies to whether his administration even wants to strike such global deals, appeared to shift by the hour. Firms across the world have been trying to come to terms with the rapid rate of presidential kneejerks: where policies can be announced, adjusted and shelved as quickly as the leader of the free world can publish a social media post. \u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty,\u201d Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair (and persona non grata in Trumpworld), observed on Wednesday. \u201cIf you talk to businesses, or market participants, or forecasters, everyone is just waiting to see how developments play out.\u201d Take strollers. This was the week when Trump argued that some prices are more important than others. After pledging to bring down prices, the president was keen to focus on those that had fallen during an NBC News interview that aired last weekend. His interviewer, however, observed that some had risen: with an estimated 97% of strollers bought in the US made in China, for example, prices have risen significantly since Trump hiked tariffs dramatically on the country. The president was having none of it. The (declining) price of fuel is \u201cthousands of times more important than a stroller\u201d, he asserted. Later in the interview, he demanded more"
